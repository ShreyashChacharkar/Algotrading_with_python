# Algo trading with machine learning
This project focuses on the implementation of machine learning techniques, specifically LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and CNN, for trend classification in the context of algorithmic trading in Futures and Options markets. Historical market data, encompassing price, oi, volume information of all strike price, is utilized to train and assess the models, data stored in MySQL server. The LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM models capture temporal dependencies, while the CNN extracts spatial features from the financial time series data. Through the optimization of model parameters and hyperparameters, the study achieves promising results in trend classification accuracy. The findings underscore the potential of these advanced neural network architectures to contribute valuable insights for traders, aiding in more informed decision-making within the dynamic landscape of financial markets.

## Introduction
Machine learning (ML) plays a pivotal role in algorithmic trading by offering sophisticated tools to analyze vast amounts of financial data, thereby enabling traders to make more informed and strategic decisions. The dynamic and complex nature of financial markets demands adaptive models capable of discerning intricate patterns and trends. ML algorithms, such as LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and CNN, bring a significant advantage by their ability to capture temporal dependencies, bidirectional information flow, and spatial features within financial time series data. These advanced techniques excel in recognizing subtle market nuances and adapting to changing conditions, providing a crucial edge in predicting trends and optimizing trading strategies. The integration of ML in algorithmic trading not only enhances decision-making accuracy but also allows for the development of adaptive systems that can evolve with market dynamics, ensuring traders stay competitive in an ever-changing financial landscape.
