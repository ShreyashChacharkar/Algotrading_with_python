# Algotrading_with_python

Algorithmic trading, often referred to as algo trading, is a method of executing trades in financial markets using pre-defined computer algorithms or sets of rules. These algorithms are designed to automate the trading process and execute orders at a speed and frequency that would be difficult or impossible for human traders to achieve manually.

Algo trading relies on advanced mathematical models, statistical analysis, and historical market data to identify trading opportunities and make informed decisions. The algorithms can be programmed to consider various factors, such as price movements, volume, technical indicators, and other market variables.

In this project, we will design algorithm to take entry using python with Algomojo along with backtesting result
